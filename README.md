# FinDAG

**FinDAG** is a high-performance, permissioned blockchain platform tailored for financial institutions and regulated entities. It leverages a directed acyclic graph (DAG) architecture, deterministic HashTimer-based ordering, and microsecond-level timestamping to enable secure, auditable, and ultra-low-latency transaction settlement.

## Features

- ⚡ **High Throughput**: Supports millions of transactions per second using parallel block inclusion.
- ⏱️ **Deterministic Ordering**: Transactions are ordered by cryptographic HashTimers instead of block height (U.S. Patent Pending).
- 🧮 **Microsecond Precision**: Network time is synchronized via FinDAG Time, ensuring accurate, tamper-proof timestamps.
- 🔐 **Permissioned Access**: Only authorized validator nodes participate in consensus and block validation.
- 🧠 **Smart Auditability**: Built-in metadata and compliance hooks for institutional reporting.
- 🌍 **Geo-Aware Architecture**: Designed for globally distributed nodes with deterministic finality.

## Use Cases

- Central bank digital currency (CBDC) infrastructure  
- Collateral settlement and custody workflows  
- Interbank DvP and PvP operations  
- Regulatory-compliant asset tracking
